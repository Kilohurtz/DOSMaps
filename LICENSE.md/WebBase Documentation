I. Libraries
Library for jQuery. <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.6.2.min.js"></script>

*NOTE*
/* As of the most recent update, the insertion of the Library seems to be malfunctioning, so as of now all jQuery commands are commented and replaced with JavaScript 
*/



II. <div>

The Div uses custom CSS modifications to set width and height to 70% to account for multiple screen sizes 
 
 
 
 
  
III.  select "continentMenu"
 Has 6 dropdown options, one for each permanetly inhabitated contenint
 Upon the selection of a continent, Calls the dropdownEvent() method (see section VI.D)  and stores the continent name in its value
 calls the method each time the dropdown value changes
   *note* this feature has been discontinued in latest version, but base codeing for event handling is still in previous versions

Values within "continentMenu"
 id="continentMenu"
 name="continentMenu"
 value=whatever is selected in the dropdown menu;
 


IV. <form>

 This sequence is created exclusively for debugging. Its purpose is to test whether eventhandlers are functioning properly.
 
  IV.A <p dropdownNotice>*
   The debugging notifier for showing whether the dropdown event handler and functions are operating properly 
   (See sections III and VI.D respectivly)
 
 
  IV.B <p infobut1> *
   The debugging notifier for showing if radio butto 1 is currently selected, should update dynamically.
   (see section V.A and VI.A for relevent information)
   
  IV.B <p infobut2> *
   The debugging notifier for showing if radio butto 2 is currently selected, should update dynamically.
   (see section V.B and VI.B for relevent information) 
 
  IV.B <p infobut3> *
   The debugging notifier for showing if radio butto 3 is currently selected, should update dynamically.
   (see section V.C and VI.C for relevent information)
 
 *currently not in published code , but available in archived versions
 
 
 
 V. Radiobuttons
  These radio buttons select the mode that the map will run in, specifically church density, whose praying for the country, and who the country is praying for
  currently these are connected to there corresponding debugging functions, detailed later.
  All radiobuttons have the same name, thereby only letting one be selected at a time. 
  input type="radio"
  name="radiobuttons"
  
  
  V.A radiobutton1
    described with text "churches/people." when selected, calls the "replacetext1()" method (see section VI.A)
    
  V.B radiobutton2
    described with text "praying for." when selected, calls the "replacetext2()" method (see section VI.B)
 
  V.C radiobutton3
    described with text "reciving prayers from." when selected, calls the "replacetext3()" method (see section VI.C)
    
    
 VI. Javascript functions *note* these debugging functions have been discontinued, but are still available in archived versions
    These are the functions called by the eventhandlers throughout the HTML document. currently they just replace text, when combined with the javascripts of diffrent sections,they will communicate with the server.
    *Note*
    /* In comments are methods using jQuery, they are currently non-functional, but in theory would accomplish the same tasks as current functions.*/
   
   VI.A replacetext1()
     is called by the selection of the first radio button (see section V.A) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut1"> with "button one clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut2> and <p="infobut3"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
    
   VI.B replacetext2()
     is called by the selection of the second radio button (see section V.B) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut2"> with "button two clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut1> and <p="infobut3"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
   
   VI.C replacetext3()
     is called by the selection of the third radio button (see section V.C) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut3"> with "button three clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut1> and <p="infobut2"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
     
   VI. dropdownEvent()
    called by the <select continentMenu> dropdown menu. (see section III)
    recives the value currently in the continentMenu and displays it in dropdownNotice (see section IV.A)
