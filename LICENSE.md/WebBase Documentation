*/

 V. Radiobuttons
  These radio buttons select the mode that the map will run in, specifically church density, whose praying for the country, and who the country is praying for

  All radiobuttons have the same name, thereby only letting one be selected at a time. 
  input type="radio"
  name="radiobuttons"
  
  
  V.A radiobutton1
    described with text "churches/people." when selected, calls the "replacetext1()" method (see section VI.A)

 VI. Javascript functions
    These are the functions called by the eventhandlers throughout the HTML document. currently they just replace text, when combined with the javascripts of diffrent sections,they will communicate with the server.
    *Note*
    /* In comments are methods using jQuery, they are currently non-functional, but in theory would accomplish the same tasks as current functions.*/
   
   VI.A replacetext1()
     is called by the selection of the first radio button (see section V.A) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut1"> with "button one clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut2> and <p="infobut3"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
    
   VI.B replacetext2()
     is called by the selection of the second radio button (see section V.B) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut2"> with "button two clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut1> and <p="infobut3"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
   
   VI.C replacetext3()
     is called by the selection of the third radio button (see section V.C) 
     when active, replaces the strings in <p="infobut3"> with "button three clicked" and the strings in <p="infobut1> and <p="infobut2"> (see section IV.B,C,D) with "button not clicked"
     in effect, this sets the other notifications to their original values, so as to only have one positive notification active at a time
     
   VI. dropdownEvent()
    called by the <select continentMenu> dropdown menu. (see section III)
    recives the value currently in the continentMenu and displays it in dropdownNotice (see section IV.A)
